# Detecting-Fake-News
### The problem.

The issue isn't just about hackers breaking into accounts and spreading false information. It's about the widespread problem of "Fake News"â€”stories that are completely made up without any real facts, sources, or quotes. Sometimes, people or bots pretend to be someone trustworthy to spread this false information. Those behind fake news often have agendas, whether political, economic, or aimed at influencing public opinion on various topics.

Today, fake news mostly originates from automated bots that tirelessly spread misinformation around the clock. Studies over the past five years have shown strong links between the spread of fake news and its impact on elections and public perceptions.

This problem is challenging because bots are becoming increasingly adept at deceiving us. It's difficult to always distinguish between true and false information. Therefore, there's a pressing need for improved systems to identify patterns of fake news. This is crucial for enhancing social media platforms, improving communication, and reducing confusion worldwide.

### Purpose.

This tutorial aims to explain methods for detecting fake news using data from various articles. These techniques are applicable in different scenarios. For developers and experts, I'll demonstrate how to use Python to load, clean, and analyze data. We'll then employ machine learning models to classify news articles as either fake or real.

### The Data.
The dataset used comes from Kaggle and can be downloaded from this link:

It consists of two files: one containing 23,481 "fake" tweets and another with 21,417 "real" articles, all written in English.
